* [yes] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [yes] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [yes] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[web developer friends, developer.mozilla.org, I basically looked up each concept I came across and browsed the different search results]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[Much of the process when creating this submission was straightforward, but a challenge I encountered was having a deep understanding of a lot of the things that were going on. Beyond just writing the code to create the game and reading through each step, I really wanted to understand exactly what was happening and especially the syntax of each language. I certainly would not have been able to create such a nice website without the walkthrough, explanations, and link to websites, but there is also a lot of learning involved in struggling through the process and piecing each step together in this way. So, throughout creating this submission, as much as I could, I attempted to look each thing that I was doing up and to create a deeper understanding of each thing that I did. I was especially confused when it came to interconnecting the css, javascript, and html. Frequently looking at online resources while also asking my web developer friends about many of the steps was really helpful, and I feel like I definitely had a deeper understanding when it came to understanding what each part of the project did. It was important to me to overcome this challenge because I did not want to just methodically go through this project, but rather truly push the boundaries of my knowledge and learn from this experience.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[Almost everything I learned while completing this project was completely new to me. It was exciting to implement everything from audio to interacting with the users’ actions. I certainly want to learn more about console and document object models. As someone working in UX/UI design, many of my questions were related to how certain things are implemented like filtering, pages that change as you scroll through, animation, navigation with multiple changes, drop-down menus, algorithms behind the scenes, etc. It really seems like the possibilities are limitless, and combined with my understanding of databases, it would be interesting to attempt to implement many different kinds of things. I also have a lot of questions around the considerations web developers make when trying to implement the best user experience and creating different user interactions. I also want to know more about how html, javascript, and css interconnect and more of the complicated things you can do when building on each.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[Because of an extremely busy week, I wasn't able to implement many of the additional features that I was interested in implementing. I was especially interested in randomizing the pattern and adding more buttons to create a more interesting game and more-closely model real-life memory computer games. Combining these two ideas, it would be interesting to create levels to the game where each user would advance to a more difficult level with more buttons and longer patterns after they complete a previous easier level. Also, with this upgrade, I would possibly make it so that users can decide which level they start on so that they do not have to go through every previous level first. This would certainly be a more challenging upgrade, but it would make the game more interesting as well as one that truly challenges users’ memory.]
